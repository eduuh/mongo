// Module summary
//  User and Roles
// MongoDB uses a role based Access control approach.
// You creat users on database and you then log in with your credentials (against those databases)
// Users have no rights by default you need to add roles to allow certains operations.
// Persmissons that are granted by roles ["Privileges"] are not only granted for the database the user was added to unless you explicity grant access to other database.
// You can use "AnyDatabase" roles for cross datbase access.

// Encryptions.
//  You can encrypt data during transportation and at rest.
//  During transportation you use TLS/ SSL to encrypt data.
//  For production, you should use SSL certificates issues by a certificates authority (Not self signed certificates.)
//  For encryption at rest you can encrypt both the files that hold your data(mode simple with "mongoDB Enterprise") and the values inside your documents.
